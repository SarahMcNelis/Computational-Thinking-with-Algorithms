# Computational-Thinking-with-Algorithms Project
by Sarah McNelis

<br>

This repository contains a project I completed as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. 

<br>

## Project Specification
- Create an application which will be used to benchmark 5 sorting algorithms. 

- Write a report on those 5 algorithms and discuss the results of the benchmarking process. 

<br>

## Overview
This repository contains the following files:

- `Report-on-Benchmarking-Sorting-Algorithms.pdf` : This file contains my explaination of 5 sorting algorithms I chose and it exaimines the benchmarking process and it's results. 

- `averages.csv` : this is used in the project.py file to write the benchmarking averages to this file for each of the sorting algorithms. 

- `bubble_sort.py` : this contains python code for a simple comparison based sorting algorithm. This file is called by the main programme; project.py

- `counting_sort.py` : this contains python code for a non-comparisson sorting algorithm. This is used in project.py also. 

- `insertion_sort.py` : this is a python file containing another comparrison based sorting algorithm. This will be called by the main programme. 

- `merge_sort.py` : this contains python code for an efficent comparison based sorting algorithm. Again, it will be used in the main programme. 

- `quick_sort.py` : this programme contains a second efficent comparison based sorting algorithm which will be used in project.py. 

- `project.py` : This is the main programme. It imports the sorting algorithms I wrote in their own individual python files as described above. This is to keep the main programme tidy. It also contains a function I created for the benchmarking process which uses lists, pandas dataframe, the random library, the time library and matplotlib pyplot libary to create the a datframe of the resutls of the benchmarking process for each sorting algorithm and plot them.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to explore different sorting algorithm, execute and analyse their effectiveness through a benchmarking process. I feel these are good skills to have obtained as a dat analyst.
